## Create a Local Virtual Environment

Open a PowerShell terminal in this cintel-05-live-updates folder on your machine. 
Create a virtual environment named .venv in the current directory. 
Verify that a .venv folder was created after running the command. 

```shell
python -m venv .venv
```

If VS Code asks to use it as the workspace folder, select Yes.

## Activate the Environment

Run the following command to activate the virtual environment we just created.
Verify that the PowerShell prompt now shows (.venv) at the beginning of the line.

```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Prepare the Environment

Run the following commands to upgrade pip and install required packages.
Rerun as needed until everything is successfully installed.

```shell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel pyodide-py
python -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

Read the requirements.txt file to see the packages we are installing.

Additional information can be found in our first Shiny repo: 
[cintel-02-app/SHINY.md](https://github.com/denisecase/cintel-02-app/blob/main/SHINY.md#step-2-prepare-virtual-environment)

-----

## Run the App

Verify your virtual environment is activated and packages have been installed. 
Run the following PowerShell command to start the app.

```shell
shiny run app.py
```

You may use `shiny run app.py --reload` but it can be harder to stop the app during development.
Open the app by following the instructions provided in the terminal. 
For example, try CTRL CLICK (at the same time) on the URL displayed (http://127.0.0.1:8000).

Hit CTRL c (at the same time) to quit the app. 
If it won't stop, close the terminal window.
Reopen the terminal window and be sure the virtual environment is activated
before running the app again.

## Deploy the App

Add and customize .github/workflows/deploy.yml.
Login to [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) then Account / Tokens and add 3 repo secrets.
See the earlier [SHINYAPPS.md](https://github.com/denisecase/cintel-02-app/blob/main/SHINYAPPS.md) for details.

- Name: SHINYAPPS_ACCOUNT, Secret: Paste shinyapps.io account name
- Name: SHINYAPPS_TOKEN, Secret: (paste token )
- Name: SHINYAPPS_SECRET, Secret: (paste secret)

```shell
rsconnect deploy shiny . --name denisecase --title cintel-05-live-updates
```

## ⚠️ Delete Hosted App Before Pushing to GitHub

Reminder: The GitHub action deploy.yml may not automatically delete an existing app from shinyapps.io so we can redeploy.

Before pushing to GitHub, login to [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) and view the list of applications. 

- First archive the app.
- Then delete the archived app.
